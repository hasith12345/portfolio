                I'm a passionate IT student with a strong foundation in computer science and software development. My
                journey began with curiosity about how technology shapes our world, and it has evolved into a deep
                commitment to creating meaningful digital experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently pursuing my degree in Information Technology, I specialize in full-stack web development, with
                expertise in modern frameworks like React, Next.js, and Node.js. I'm particularly interested in the
                intersection of user experience and technical innovation.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or
                mentoring fellow students. I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry
                trends.
